### Align Incentives Across Cases for Domain Specific Scientific Software

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXr0LNdQUU)

This talk is based on experience in the field of economics trying to include
software engineering as a research method. Great talk on pedagogy and how
the act of building software via apprenticeship education model can enhance
the learning process.

### Continuous Integration for Scientific Python Projects

CI: The practice of having developers continually integrate their updates into
the main development branch. More commonly, it is the set of processes and
tools that make the frequent code merges possible while maintaining developer
productivity and code quality.

CI infrastructure is an investment that will pay for itself if:
- faster development velocity for maintainers
- fewer "but it works on my machine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" bugs
- more reliable support of other OS's and hardware
- quicker turn around on software releases
- increased confidence for new contributors

CI is a process, not a program.
- Start with requirements: "what code needs testing? how often? which to run?
  which environments need to be tested? What reporting do you need?
- Be prepared to make pragmatic compromises: "run subsets of tests depending on
  certain conditions"

This talk goes through many of the considerations, tools, and tips/tricks for
implementing CI.

JPL lab: using simulations to model robots, etc. to run Monte Carlo simulations
- Use JupyterHub to simplify logistics for wide variety of users, they ran
  a workshop for how to use their simulation platform.
- They developed a notebook extension for 3D visualization.

### pyhf: A Pure Python Statistical Fitting Library with Tensors and Autograd

Analyze/model high energy particle physics data by smashing particles together
at near-speed-of-light. Backends: numpy, scipy, pytorch, tensorflow, jax.

- Accelerating fitting library
- Use JSON schema for declerative models
- Enabling technology for reinterpretation

### Scikit Geometry and Generic Computing in Python

`scikit-geometry` brings computational geometry to Python with a comprehensive
number of geometric types, e.g. lines, rays, circles in a `scikit-learn`
compatible interface.

### GPU Packaging for the Community
