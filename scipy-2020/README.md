# Scipy Conference 2020

Conference Proceedings: https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2020

This was my first year attending (and presenting) at the scipy conference, and
even though I didn't have a baseline set of expectations based on the past
in-person gatherings, I thought it was well-organized ‚≠êÔ∏è, informative ü§Ø,
and educational üìñ.

Most of the talks were pre-recorded, except for the fantastic keynote talks,
grouped by themes like **machine learning** and **biology & bioinformatics**.
Here are my notes from the 5-day conference:

- [Day 1](2020-07-06-notes.md)
- [Day 2](2020-07-07-notes.md)
- [Day 3](2020-07-08-notes.md)
- [Day 4](2020-07-09-notes.md)
- [Day 5](2020-07-10-notes.md)

I also gave lightning talk on my independent research on metalearning and
automl, which can be found
