### Frictionless Data for Reproducible Biology

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAi4OnfH-Q)

How to use the `frictionlessdata` ecosystem to encourage scientific
reproducibility by making it easier for engineers, analysts to work with messy
data.

### Continual Updating of Evolutionary Estimates in the Open Tree of Life

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNF_Fv7KT-I)

Using Open Tree of Life and open data sources to continually update the
evolutionary tree of life. Link together different data sources and modalities
to create coherent picture of life: phylogenetic, raw molecular, and curated
molecular data.

### Making Sense of Clinical Data

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc7e7OxopdA)

Nice comparison/contrast on scientific method vs. engineering method in the
context of science and medicine.

Case study: Studying cognitive dysfunction in HIV. The speaker does a good job
of questioning traditional definitions of cognitive dysfunction among people
with HIV, and makes a great case for re-defining cognitive dysfunction in this
context, while providing solid evidence-based reasoning.

Paper: cognitive trajectory phenotypes in human immunodeficiency
virus-infected patients.
- looked at cohort of people with HIV, visited research lab multiple times,
  roughly six months apart, providing bio samples and battery of cognitive
  tests.
- who's getting better and who's getting worse? try to find effective
  intervention.
  - plots: density plots - difference score of cognitive tests based on two
    visits.
  - parallel coodinates plot: patterns in change scores in cognitive metrics.
  - correlation of change plot among cognitive metrics.
  - PCA: find factors of variability in cognitive test data.
  - Clustering: K-means (used elbow method) and silhoette plots to see degree
    of separation of clusters.
  - Find clusters of people who show similar patterns of change in different
    cognitive metrics.

### Why Design Abstraction Matters for Analytics Tools: Neuroimaging analysis with Neuro-Learn

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc7e7OxopdA)

Nice talk about finding the right level of abstraction for data analytics
software to facility self-directed learning and expressivity to take a
scientific idea from concept to code.

- Tools with good abstraction make it easy to grow your conceptual
  understanding.
